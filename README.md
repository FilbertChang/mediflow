## Quick Start

### Without Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FilbertChang/mediflow.git
cd mediflow

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/mediflow
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD
SECRET_KEY=<32-byte hex string from secrets.token_hex(32)>
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=480
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.com
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langsmith_key
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=mediflow
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434

# Alerting (required for email notifications)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
ALERT_EMAIL_FROM=mediflow@yourdomain.com
ALERT_EMAIL_TO=doctor@hospital.com

# Alerting (optional — only if using Slack)
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxx
```

Then run:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### With Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FilbertChang/mediflow.git
cd mediflow
# Create .env file as above
docker-compose up --build
```

Open **http://localhost:8000**

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Ollama with Llama 3.2 — `ollama pull llama3.2`
- PostgreSQL (or Docker — PostgreSQL is included automatically)
- LangSmith account (free) — https://smith.langchain.com
- SendGrid account (free tier) — https://sendgrid.com

## Alert System

MediFlow automatically analyzes every extraction result through a multi-layer detection pipeline:

| Check | Method | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Missing critical fields (diagnosis, medications, patient name) | Rule-based | Warning |
| High-risk ICD-10 codes (MI, sepsis, stroke, PE, etc.) | Hardcoded list (~25 codes) | Critical |
| Narrow therapeutic index medications (Warfarin, Digoxin, Lithium, etc.) | Hardcoded list | Warning |
| Known drug-drug interactions (30+ pairs) | Hardcoded ruleset | Critical |
| Unknown drug-drug interactions | Llama 3.2 LLM fallback | Critical |

When alerts are detected:
- User is automatically navigated to the **Alerts page**
- Unread badge appears on the sidebar nav item
- Email digest sent via SendGrid
- Slack message posted (if `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` is configured)

## Policy Compliance System

Admins can configure hospital protocols that are automatically checked after every extraction:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| Policy Documents | Upload PDF/DOCX/TXT hospital SOPs — ingested into a dedicated FAISS vectorstore |
| Manual Rules | Add structured IF/THEN rules via UI (e.g. "If Pneumonia → must prescribe Amoxicillin") |
| Auto Check | Every extraction triggers a RAG-based compliance check against all active policies |
| Deviation Alerts | Non-compliant extractions are flagged with `policy_violation` alerts |
| Compliance History | All checks are logged with status (compliant / deviation / unknown) and full deviation details |

## Security

| Protection | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Authentication | JWT tokens with 8-hour expiry |
| Password hashing | bcrypt |
| Role-based access | Admin, Doctor, Nurse with different permissions |
| XSS protection | HTML sanitization on all rendered output |
| CORS | Restricted to localhost origins |
| Path traversal | Filename validation on all file operations |
| File size limit | 10MB max upload size |
| Secrets | All credentials in `.env`, never committed |
| File validation | MIME type checking via magic bytes (not just extension) |
| SQL injection | SQLAlchemy ORM parameterized queries + filename validation |
| Rate limiting | 10 req/min on AI endpoints, 20 req/min on ingestion (slowapi) |
